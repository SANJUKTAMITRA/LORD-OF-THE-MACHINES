Coding has been done in R. initially logistic regression has been done
Later randome forest and naive bayes has been impemented for the same problem
while with randome forest the sensitivity (with positive is_click as 1) is around 20%

with Naive Bayes algorithim the sensitivity (with positive is_click as 1) is more than 80%
